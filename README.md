# Stack Underflow | SOF Clone | MERN-GraphQL

**Update 1:** This project is a fork from [amand33p](https://github.com/amand33p). I have been making some efforts to replace `material-ui` with `twin.macro` just to learn react, CSS and make reusable components myself. It's been a great journey so far and I learned a lot from `material-ui`, they did solid work with their lib and also used a tonne of `useRef` üòÖ to opt-out of react default rendering behaviour.

**Update 2:** Migrated Server codebase to **Typescript** using `type-graphql`, `typegoose`.

**Update 3:** Migrated Client codebase to **Typescript** using `graphql`, `@graphql-codegen` üíö ,`definitelyTyped` libs.

**Update 4: (27/10/2021)** Automated Graphql Testing using `jest`, `ts-jest`, `isomorphic-fetch`.

**Update 5: (29/10/2021)** Replaced constant growing arrays with mongoose virtuals.

**Update 6: (4/05/2022)** Moving to Hybrid(poly repo + mono repo) structure to reduce code,build management issues, also I am not using tools like Nx,turborepo,bazel which would mitigate those issues.

## Future

1. <strike>Automate Graphql Testing</strike> ‚úîÔ∏è
2. <strike>Replace constant growing arrays in schema as mongoose document sizelimit is **16MB** </strike>. ‚úîÔ∏è
3. Use transactions in mutation resolvers which involves multiple mutating db requests.

## Usage

#### Env variable:

Create a .env file in server directory and add the following:

```
MONGODB_URI = "Your Mongo URI"
PORT = 4000
JWT_SECRET = "Your JWT secret"

```

#### Server:

```
yarn install
yarn server dev
```
